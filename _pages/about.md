Hi, I am Heyu, a second-year CS PhD student at Stanford, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Ellen Vitercik](https://vitercik.github.io/). 
Previously, I graduated from University of Cambridge with BA+MEng in Computer Science, where I was supervised by [Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/). 
My research interests lie in graph neural networks, geometric deep learning, and their applications in combinatorial optimization.
