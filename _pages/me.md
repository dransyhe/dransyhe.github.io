"Yu" is my given name, and "He" is my family name. Both of them unfortunately 
coincide with some English pronouns. 
Thanks to Singapore's effort in addressing different name orders,
I am used to being called as "He Yu" in the English context. 
Nowadays, I chose to go by "Heyu" for less (or maybe more) confusion. 

For Cambridge CompScis, here's some [advice for Part II dissertation](https://dransyhe.github.io/blog/2022/part-ii-dissertation/).

I am learning the Tibetan language, see [Lhasa Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhasa_Tibetan).
My favourite thing in this world is [baozi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi), especially [tangbao](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g294220-d3402812-Reviews-JiMing_Tangbao_MingWa_Lang-Nanjing_Jiangsu.html), 
[shengjianbao](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g308272-d4048556-Reviews-XiaoYang_ShengJian_ShanXi_North_Road-Shanghai.html), 
and [momos](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d12991530-Reviews-Tibet_Kitchen_London-London_England.html). 
I have explored all Tibetan restaurants I know in the UK.
