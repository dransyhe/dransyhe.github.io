"Yu" is my given name, and "He" is my family name. I did my secondary education in Singapore, where different name orders were 
properly addressed. Therefore, I am used to being called as "He Yu" in the English context, as it should be in Chinese. 
Nowadays, I chose to go by "Heyu" for less (or maybe more) confusion. 

For Cambridge CompScis, here's some [advice for Part II dissertation](https://dransyhe.github.io/blog/2022/part-ii-dissertation/).

I am learning Tibetan. Here is something that I'd like to share:

<center>
བྲིས་པའི་ཡི་གེ་ནག་ཅུང།<br>
ཆུ་དང་ཐིག་པས་བཤིགས་སོང།             <br>
མ་བྲིས་སེམས་ཀྱི་རི་མོ།       <br>
བསུབས་ཀྱང་ཟུབ་རྒྱུ་མི་འདུག།  <br>

Little letters written in black,   <br>
Are washed away by raindrops;  <br>
Unwritten lines on the heart,  <br>
Can never be erased.<br>
